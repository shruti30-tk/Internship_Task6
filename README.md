# Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation

## Goal
To explore how password complexity impacts security by testing different passwords on strength checkers and learning best practices.

## Tools Used
- [PasswordMeter](https://passwordmeter.com)
- [HowSecureIsMyPassword](https://howsecureismypassword.net)

## What I Did
- Created passwords of various strengths (weak to strong)
- Tested them on the above tools
- Analyzed feedback and scoring
- Researched password attacks and protection methods

## Sample Passwords & Results

| Password       | Strength | Crack Time       |
|----------------|----------|------------------|
| `shruti123`     | Weak     | < 1 second       |
| `Shruti@123`    | Medium   | A few hours      |
| `Sh!2025Secure$` | Strong | Trillions of years |

## Key Learnings
- Strong passwords are long and random.
- Avoid dictionary words, names, and patterns.
- Use symbols, numbers, and a mix of upper/lowercase letters.
- MFA and password managers greatly enhance security.

## Common Attacks
- **Brute-force:** Cracks short/simple passwords quickly.
- **Dictionary attack:** Exploits common passwords.
- **Credential stuffing:** Reuses leaked credentials.

## Best Practices
- Use at least 12 characters
- Include symbols and mix cases
- Never reuse passwords
- Prefer passphrases and password managers
